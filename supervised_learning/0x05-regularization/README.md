# 0x05. Regularization

In the following directory we will find a copilation of files wich porpuse is to understand the concept of regularization and help us to answer the enxt questions.
-   What is regularization? What is its purpose?
-   What is are L1 and L2 regularization? What is the difference between the two methods?
-   What is dropout?
-   What is early stopping?
-   What is data augmentation?
-   How do you implement the above regularization methods in Numpy? Tensorflow?
-   What are the pros and cons of the above regularization methods?atrix
