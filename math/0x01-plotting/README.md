        * The title should be Men's Height vs Weight
        * The data should be plotted as magenta points

* **2. Change of scale**
  * [2-change_scale.py](./2-change_scale.py)
  * Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y as a line graph:

        * The x-axis should be labeled Time (years)
        * The y-axis should be labeled Fraction Remaining
        * The title should be Exponential Decay of C-14
        * The y-axis should be logarithmically scaled
        * The x-axis should range from 0 to 28650

* **3. Two is better than one**
  * [3-two.py](./3-two.py)
  * Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y1 and x ↦ y2 as line graphs:

        * The x-axis should be labeled Time (years)
        * The y-axis should be labeled Fraction Remaining
        * The title should be Exponential Decay of Radioactive Elements
        * The x-axis should range from 0 to 20,000
        * The y-axis should range from 0 to 1
        * x ↦ y1 should be plotted with a dashed red line
        * x ↦ y2 should be plotted with a solid green line
        * A legend labeling x ↦ y1 as C-14 and x ↦ y2 as Ra-226 should be placed in the upper right hand corner of the plot

* **4. Frequency**
  * [4-frequency.py](./4-frequency.py)
  * Complete the following source code to plot a histogram of student scores for a project:

        * The x-axis should be labeled Grades
        * The y-axis should be labeled Number of Students
        * The x-axis should have bins every 10 units
        * The title should be Project A
        * The bars should be outlined in black

* **5. All in One**
  * [5-all_in_one.py](./5-all_in_one.py)
  * Complete the following source code to plot all 5 previous graphs in one figure:

        * All axis labels and plot titles should have a font size of x-small (to fit nicely in one figure)
        * The plots should make a 3 x 2 grid
        * The last plot should take up two column widths (see below)
        * The title of the figure should be All in One

* **6. Stacking Bars**
  * [6-bars.py](./6-bars.py)
  * Complete the following source code to plot a stacked bar graph:

        * fruit is a matrix representing the number of fruit various people possess
        * The bars should represent the number of fruit each person possesses
        * The y-axis should be labeled Quantity of Fruit
        * The y-axis should range from 0 to 80 with ticks every 10 units
        * The title should be Number of Fruit per Person
